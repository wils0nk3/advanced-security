**Documentation of advanced security governance, proactive threat modeling, and forensic protocols for systems requiring maximum data integrity and defensibility.**

This repository details high-level security assurance processes, demonstrating commitment to maintaining system integrity against sophisticated adversarial actions across various projects.

## I. 🔑 Integrity & Forensic Protocols

This section focuses on the methods used to secure data against compromise and prove its authenticity—a cornerstone of advanced security and litigation-readiness.

* **Tamper Detection Logic:** Documentation of cryptographic methods (e.g., hashing and ledger models) used to establish an immutable **Chain of Custody** for digital assets and data logs.
* **Data Export Verification:** Protocols detailing the secure packaging and verification procedures for sharing high-integrity data with third parties or for investigative review.
* **Secure Deletion Policies:** Standards for permanently destroying sensitive data across systems (e.g., mobile clients, servers) to mitigate risk of exposure.

## II. 🚨 Threat Governance & Assurance

This showcases your expertise in strategic, managerial security practices (Threat Modeling, Policy, and Review).

* **Adversarial Threat Modeling:** Documentation of methodologies used to systematically identify and mitigate risks related to system integrity, repudiation, and privilege escalation (e.g., STRIDE analysis).
* **Secure Code Review Policy:** Outlines the mandatory security checklist, peer-review process, and coding standards strictly enforced to prevent common application-layer vulnerabilities ($\text{OWASP}$ adherence).
* **Vulnerability Disclosure Policy:** A template policy detailing how security researchers can responsibly disclose vulnerabilities found in any public or accessible component of a managed system.

***

## III. 📱 System Hardening & Controls

This addresses the security requirements for the underlying environment and deployment pipeline.

* **Principle of Least Privilege:** Standards for granular access control and continuous auditing to ensure that users and processes have only the minimum permissions necessary to perform their required tasks.
* **Zero Trust Micro-segmentation:** Protocols for designing internal network and cloud resource segmentation, strictly limiting lateral movement within the environment.
* **Secure Mobile Environment Controls:** Policies for protecting the client-side environment, including requirements for device-native secure storage and secure input handling.
